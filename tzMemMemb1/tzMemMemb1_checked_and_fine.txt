scaffold_100	Mollusca (could be arthropod contamination, but not sure)
scaffold_131	Chordata (conserved ATP-ase)
scaffold_140	no-hit (would leavei)
scaffold_146	no-hit
scaffold_146	no-hit (would leave)
scaffold_146	no-hit (would leave)
scaffold_19	Arthropoda (has only a very small hit to Arthropoda)
scaffold_21	Viruses-undef
scaffold_22	Viruses-undef
scaffold_24	Chordata (looks like a big mix of things, so I would say fine)
scaffold_3	Chordata (looks like a big mix of things, so I would say fine)
scaffold_39	no-hit (would leave)
scaffold_46	Arthropoda (looks like a big mix of things, so I would say fine)
